// Controllers

So the main responsibility of the controller is making sure that we have enough data
to send these requests to the service and that's it. // See Chart for services


Controllers are just putting to the service and whatever the service returns they
return that same response to the client.

So basically the service is where we contain the entire business logic of our
application.
